Now I'ma say this one time, boy, and that's my word
We rockin' shots and not fire through the Hindenburg
The contribution is clear, you add water to bone
And get the Jurassic 5 on the microphone
Now if you like the tone and how the harmony's done
And the sucka emcees die before they've begun
Well, I'd like to know if you've got the notion
'Cause we're number one
I'm not trying to say my style is better than yours
I'm just on some other shit
I'm all about the beats and the lyrics
So when you hear it, you can feel it
The vibe is energized by the presence of my spirit
No interference, we persevere
The purpose is clear
We're here to leave your ear hurtin' severe
You're lurking in fear
'Cause we take it back like Robin Loxley
Rockin' from countryside to spots where hard rocks be
I often wonder if these emcees even know how it feels
To dedicate they whole life to this mic of steel
It's not about the bills, that's not keeping it real
A lot of tight rappers out here ain't got no deals
We appeal to the brothers with flow finesse
'Cause it's the hundred-watt bloodshot Game of Death
'Cause we're protected by the covenants of words and beats
Rewind and feel the heat, recline and take a seat
So, uh, let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live emcees
Playground tactics, no rabbit in a hat tricks
Just that classic rap shit from Jurassic
Let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live emcees
Playground tactics, no rabbit in a hat tricks
Just that classic rap shit from Jurassic

Now I walk from Tranzania, earthquake Transylvania
And on the way, I kicked a hole through the Wall of China
Just to get the right blend
'Cause I'm schizophrenic of the pen
Wait a minute, I fell into the deep end
You shouldn't have told me
The pyramids can hold me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your beats, pull out your cuts
Give us a mic (What up?), and we gon' tear shit up
I'm on some old and forgotten
Sun up to sundown like picking cotton
The Nutty Professor science droppin'
Rockin' Robin's hood from New York to Compton
Me and my three sons, Jabari, Shakir, and Kahsum
So, uh, let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live emcees
Playground tactics, no rabbit in a hat tricks
Just that classic rap shit from Jurassic
Let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live emcees
Playground tactics, no rabbit in a hat tricks
Just that classic rap shit from Jurassic

Hey, I'm 2na-Fish from U-N-I-T-Y
Do or die, anti-Illuminati, why
Do the liquid from my vocals make the ghetto start swimmin'?
Forever winning, I'm in it like Meadowlark Lemon
I get goosebumps when the bassline thumps
A sucka emcee freestyle, he had mine for lunch
Marc 7even get you open like an attach√©
Briefcase, in this case, the victor is no way
Ah, ah, the tool spinners, cookin' a full dinner
Killin' the firstborn of lyrical Yul Brynners
When is it the academy rattling your anatomy?
Gotta be J5 so kill all of your fake flattery
That'll be the day when labels pay our way
2na, what you say when emcees come to play?
Man fi dead, 'cause we take it back like Spinal Tap
Preparing your intellect before your final nap
So, uh, let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live emcees
Playground tactics, no rabbit in a hat tricks
Just that classic rap shit from Jurassic
Let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live emcees
Playground tactics, no rabbit in a hat tricks

Just got beef, huh, watch how I settle it
I'll fuck around and arrest your whole development
I'm eloquent when it comes to digital display
I'm ready for the world while you 'url off the Tanqueray
Tactics, my shit's Jurassic 5
Fingers of death while you exhale and inhale
With a deep breath with my chop suey style
'Cause I'm a lyrical chef, I gets mines to the death
'Cause I be cookin', from here to Brooklyn
Your shit's annoying like fat-ass Bookman on Good Times
When I rhyme, I hit the designated area
I hope you got your shots, 'cause this is lyrical malaria
Spreadin', beheadin' fools with the punishment
I live in America, but fuck this government
A hundred and fifty times over silk with lead
While y'all drink the Similac, my rhymes are breast-fed
No artificial nipples, I flip the real skills
I thought I told you once, I kick the lyrical windmills
And backspin Benedict strictly for my benefit
I step on toes when I flow, don't get offended
Come and get with it, comprehended when I kick it
I represent the real from the beginning to the end of it
